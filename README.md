Project title: Fast Food Advisor

Motivation: We chose this problem because obesity has become a major global health issue, and frequent consumption of fast food is one of its leading contributors. Since many people rely on fast food due to its convenience and accessibility, completely avoiding it is often unrealistic. Therefore, our goal is to help users make smarter and healthier choices when selecting fast-food meals. By providing personalized nutritional recommendations, our system aims to reduce the negative health impact associated with fast food consumption and promote more balanced eating habits among users. We selected the “Nutritional Fast Food Dataset” from Kaggle because it provides detailed nutrient values (calories, protein, fat, sodium, sugar, carbohydrates, etc.) across multiple fast-food restaurants. These attributes are ideal for building an advice system that tailors recommendations to each user’s nutritional needs.
